Our main coding language is java, and a lot of tutorials online seem to be written in python. Hopefully there isn't too much trouble translating between languages. This tutorial seems pretty detailed:
1. Python: https://medium.com/@domspaulo/python-implementation-of-sha-256-from-scratch-924f660c5d57
And here are some others
2. Java: https://github.com/softknk/SHA256
3. C: https://www.tony.software/posts/sha256_building_hash_algorithm_scratch/
4. JavaScript: https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html

Reading tutorial and breaking down the task into multiple parts so we can work on different parts at once.
