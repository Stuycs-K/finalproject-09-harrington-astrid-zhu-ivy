### 2025-05-16 - Finding sources
Our main coding language is java, and a lot of tutorials online seem to be written in python. Hopefully there isn't too much trouble translating between languages. This tutorial seems pretty detailed:
1. Python: https://medium.com/@domspaulo/python-implementation-of-sha-256-from-scratch-924f660c5d57
And here are some others
2. Java: https://github.com/softknk/SHA256
3. C: https://www.tony.software/posts/sha256_building_hash_algorithm_scratch/
4. JavaScript: https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html

Reading tutorial and breaking down the task into multiple parts so we can work on different parts at once.
We're going to try how to compute sha256 hash by hand to better understand the process.
