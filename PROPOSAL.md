# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Astrid Harrington and Ivy Zhu

# Intentions:

We are going to code a replica of the sha256 algorithm in Java.
    
# Intended usage:

Users will be able to use a makefile to run our Java program with a given input String, and they will see the sha256 hash printed out.
  
# Technical Details:

We will break down the project into two parts, preprocessing and transform. Preprocessing will consist of the initial steps necessary to transform the given String into a format that can be processed by transform. Transform will enact the steps in the algorithm. Preprocessing will require reading a String as bytes, converting it into an array of ints that represent the individual bits (and padding it and modifying it as necessary). Transform will require bitwise operations like shifting, rotating, xor, and and. Astrid will be responsible for preprocessing and Ivy will code transform.
    
# Intended pacing:

First week: finish sha256.
Second week: write Presentation.md and record video.
