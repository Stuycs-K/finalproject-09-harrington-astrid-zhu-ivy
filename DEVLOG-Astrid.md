### 2025-05-16 - Preliminary Research

We located the following four sources for constructing sha256:

1. Python: https://medium.com/@domspaulo/python-implementation-of-sha-256-from-scratch-924f660c5d57
2. Java: https://github.com/softknk/SHA256
3. C: https://www.tony.software/posts/sha256_building_hash_algorithm_scratch/
4. JavaScript: https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html

We are going to spent some time investigating these sources. We plan to do our project in Java, but haven't found a walkthrough in Java (all we have is an example sha256 encoder). However, the Python walkthrough seems approachable and will probably be helpful.

We are struggling to understand the steps involved in building sha256, so we are going to read through the following document:

https://github.com/liangtengyu/wx_gzh_article/blob/master/How%20SHA-2%20Works%20Step-By-Step%20(SHA-256).md

Then we will create a plan for how to proceed.
